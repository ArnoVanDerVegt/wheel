This project contains a compiler and virtual machine.
The compiler is written in Javascript and compiles code which can be executed on an EV3 block on your EV3.

The Wheel compiler and VM are my little side project, the goal of this project is to create a tool which allows you to
combine a scripting language with the existing EV3 blocks.
